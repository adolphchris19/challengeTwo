This project is a quiz app, that contains questions ranging English, Mathematics, Chemistry and Physics. Yeah these were my favourite subjects in High school, and I thought it proper to create  this application so we could all test our basic knowledge in these genres. 

The chemistry, physics and mathematics fields contains Ten(10) questions each, while the English segment contains a comprehension passage, and five questions. Learning should be fun, and we should learn in a fun way.
